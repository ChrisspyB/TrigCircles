		<h2>Sinusoids and Circles</h2>
		Every sinusoidal function can be represented by a corresponding circle. By tracing the our height as we travel along the circumference of a circle, we produce a sine wave of period 2&pi;, <span class="eqn">sin(x)</span>.<br>
		<div class = "precaption">Click on the diagram to draw a wave.</div>
		<div class ="interactive" id="sin_trace"></div>
		If were to instead start tracing from the top of the circle (90&deg; or 0.5&pi; later) the same procedure produces a cosine wave, <span class="eqn">cos(x)</span>.<br>
		<div class ="interactive" id="cos_trace"></div>
		Where we start drawing the wave is its <b>initial phase</b>. The above diagram demonstrates that <span class="eqn">cos(x)</span> and <span class="eqn">sin(x)</span> have a phase difference of 0.5&pi; radians i.e. <span class="eqn">cos(x) = sin(x+0.5&pi;)</span>.<br><br>
		By adjusting the circle's radius, our starting position and how quickly we trace the circle we can plot arbitrary sinusoidal functions of the form <span class="eqn">Asin(&omega;x+&phi;)</span>. Fiddle with the sliders below, and watch how it affects both the circle and waveform.<br>

		<h2>Sums of Circles</h2>
		If an arbitrary sine function has a corresponding circle, it follows that a sum of two sine waves can be represented by a corresponding sum of circles.<br>

		<h2>Fourier Series</h2>
		As it turns out, any periodic function can be expressed as an infinite sum of sin and cos functions of different amplitudes and frequencies. As such, any periodic function can be visualised with an infinite number of circles!
		We can't really draw an infinite number of circles, but we can approximate by drawing the first few in the series.
		<div class = "precaption">Try adding terms while in <b>SCAN</b> mode and watch as the waveform begins to take shape.</div>

	<div id="travelling">
		<h2>Travelling Waves</h2>
		So far we have only considered functions of a single variable, <span class="eqn">x</span>. Our circles can model how a single atom's position varies with time, or a how vibration in a string varies with position. If we want to consider waves which vary with time and position, a travelling wave, each point in space needs to have its own set of circles which oscillate in time.<br>
