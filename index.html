		<h2>Sinusoids and Circles</h2>
		Consider the unit circle. Starting from the positive x-axis and tracing the circle, plotting the y coordinate as a function of the polar angle t, we produce a sine wave of period 2pi i.e. <span id="eqn">y = sin(t)</span>.<br>
		<div class ="interactive" id="small_sin_trace">#small_sin_trace</div>
		If were to instead start tracing 90 degrees later i.e. from the positive y-axis we see that the same procedure produces a cosine wave. This isn't surprising, given that <span id="eqn">cos(t) = sin(t+90)</span>.<br>
		<div class ="interactive" id="small_cos_trace">#small_cos_trace</div>
		By varying the parameters of the circle, we can plot arbitrary sinusoidal functions <span id="eqn">Asin(t+&alpha;)</span>. Notice how varying the radius, trace speed and starting position affects the amplitude, frequency and phase-offset of the resulting sinusoid.<br>

		<h2>Sums of Circles</h2>
		We have just shown that an arbitrary sin function is represented by a circle when considering <span id="eqn">y(t)</span>. It follows that a sum of two sine waves can be represented by a corresponding sum of circles.<br>

		<h2>Fourier Series</h2>
		From the study of Fourier Analysis, it turns out that any periodic function can be expressed as an infinite sum of sines and cosines, provided the function <span id="eqn">f(x)</span>.
		<ul>
			<li>has a finite period,</li>
			<li>is single valued,</li>
			<li>has an finite number of maxima/minima over one period,</li>
			<li>has a finite number of discontinuities over one period,</li>
			<li>encloses a finite area over one period.</li>
		</ul>
		Provided these conditions are met, the series will converge (non-uniformly) to the <span id="eqn">f(x)</span> at all points were <span id="eqn">f(x)</span> is continuous. At singularities, the series converges to the mid point of <span id="eqn">f(x)</span> either side of the discontinuity.<br>
		<i>These conditions are sufficient but not necessary: there exists (weird) functions with a convergent fourier series that do not satisfy these conditions.</i><br><br>
		It follows therefore that periodic functions can be <b>approximated</b> by truncating the series to include only the first few terms: a finite sum of sines and cosines and can therefore be visualised as a finite sum of circles.<br>
		Some common periodic functions are shown below.
