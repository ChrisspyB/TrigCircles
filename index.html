		<h2>Sinusoids and Circles</h2>
		Consider the unit circle. Starting from the positive x-axis and tracing the circle, plotting the y coordinate as a function of the polar angle t, we produce a sine wave of period 2pi i.e. <span id="eqn">y = sin(t)</span>.<br>
		<div class ="interactive" id="sin_trace">#small_sin_trace</div>
		If were to instead start tracing 90 degrees later i.e. from the positive y-axis we see that the same procedure produces a cosine wave. This isn't surprising, given that <span id="eqn">cos(t) = sin(t+90)</span>.<br>
		<div class ="interactive" id="cos_trace">#small_cos_trace</div>
		By varying the parameters of the circle, we can plot arbitrary sinusoidal functions <span id="eqn">Asin(t+&alpha;)</span>. Notice how varying the radius, trace speed and starting position affects the amplitude, frequency and phase-offset of the resulting sinusoid.<br>

		<h2>Sums of Circles</h2>
		We have just shown that an arbitrary sin function is represented by a circle when considering <span id="eqn">y(t)</span>. It follows that a sum of two sine waves can be represented by a corresponding sum of circles.<br>

		<h2>Fourier Series</h2>
		From fourier analysis, it turns out that any <i>well-behaved</i> periodic function can be expressed as an infinte sum of sin and cos functions of different amplitudes and frequencies. As such, any periodic function can be visualised with an infinte number of circles!
		We can't really draw an infinte number of circles, but we can approximate by drawing the first few in the series.

		<h2>Travelling Waves</h2>
		So far we have only looked at functions of a single variable (eg space or time, but never both).
		Imagine we're watching water waves in a transparant bowl from a side view. We can model the change in height of the wave across the bowl at a single point in time OR how the height changes with time at a single point in the wave.
		We cannot fully model what we see in the world without both spatial and temporal considerations.<br>
